            <p>Yo! You’ve officially entered The RetroZone—your ultimate blast-from-the-past corner of the internet where it’s always Saturday morning, your Game Boy never dies, and everything smells faintly of Blockbuster popcorn and Capri Sun.</p>
            <p>This ain't your average page. This is a cyber shrine to the dopest games, the freshest beats, and the sickest movies from the raddest decade ever—the 90s. Whether you're here to relive that Final Fantasy VII boss fight, vibe to some Spice Girls on loop, or debate whether The Matrix is sci-fi or a lifestyle—you're in the right place, dude.</p>

                <h2>The Dial-Up Dilemma</h2>
                <p>It was 1998, and I had just discovered the wild world of Yahoo chatrooms. I was mid-conversation with a "Sk8rBoi93" when suddenly—the internet cut out. My mom had picked up the phone to call Aunt Linda. I screamed, “MOM! I was ONLINE!” She calmly replied, “You’ll survive.” I didn’t. Not emotionally.</p>

            <div class="div2">
                <h2>Tamagotchi Tragedy</h2>
                <p>I left my Tamagotchi with my best friend for one weekend while I went camping. I came back to find it... gone. “It evolved into a ghost,” she said. I never trusted her again. That thing was basically my child. RIP PixelBaby.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="div3">
                <h2>VCR Warzone</h2>
                <p>My brother and I had one job: record Friends while our parents were out. He forgot to rewind the tape, so halfway through Monica yelling at Ross, it cut to an old episode of MacGyver. I still haven’t forgiven him. “We were on a break” became personal.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="div4">
                <h2>CD Skip Saga</h2>
                <p>I bought my first Backstreet Boys CD and played it non-stop on my anti-skip Walkman. Thought I was invincible—until I tried jogging with it. Halfway through "I Want It That Way," it started skipping like a scratched record. I dramatically lip-synced through the glitches like I was in a post-breakup music video.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="div5">
                <h2>The LimeWire Curse</h2>
                <p>Wanted to download Blue (Da Ba Dee), ended up with a 12-minute remix that started with “YOU WOULDN’T DOWNLOAD A CAR.” My computer got 37 viruses. The family PC screamed every time it turned on after that. But hey, at least I got half the song.</p>
